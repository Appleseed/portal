Version 1

This module administrators to give permission to other roles to add modules.
You can also assign default permissions for modules. I.e. If you give a role add permission, it will have add
permission for all modules added using this tool (e.g. journalist). If you add a role to add and edit (e.g. copywriter) 
then that role will by default have add and edit permissions to all modules added. And if you wish to allow a role to 
have add,edit and delete permissions (e.g. an editor) then you can do that too. Just tick the editor role on add, edit and delete.
This module also allows people to see what a module does before adding it using the new help system.
