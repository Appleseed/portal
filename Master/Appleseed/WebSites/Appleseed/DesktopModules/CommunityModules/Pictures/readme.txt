Issues and Known problems:
- Version 1.0 only in english (the code is only partly localized)
- No complete test so use it carefully.

Features I intend to put but still not there are as follows:
- Paging
- Make templates more flexible. (You can't do the XP thing right now)
- Image handler support
- Update and add another (Can we add this to Appleseed core?)
- Make templates look pretty/Offer various templates
- Crop option
