Hi Guys,

I searched around for information on the provider model and came across a few things.

The sites that I know of that implement this pattern are:

http://www.communityserver.org and www.dotnetnuke.com

I used James Geurts' System.Configuration.Provider code as a basis for this provider. I'd like to thank him for 
making his code available to help others.

I also read rob's articles:

Here are some more resources:

Followed by this (He actually implements the code he was talking about):

Here is some more provider stuff that makes interesting reading (see comments too):

Have a read, a tinker and let me know what you think ;-)

The compiled dlls are already in Appleseed's bin and I have added the web.config stuff.
